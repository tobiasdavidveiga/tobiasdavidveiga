# ⚙️ Automation Enjoyer  

I let computers do my chores; an automation enthusiast driven by caffeine and slightly allergic to repetitive tasks.
Always enjoy attending tech events and connecting with people who are building genuinely cool things.

My tools of choice? Anything that supports clean code and seamless integration; from Python scripts to C# logic and visual workflows.

Let’s build something smart (or at least funny) together! ☕🤖
