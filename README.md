# ⚙️ Automation Enjoyer  

I make computers do my chores — automation enthusiast, caffeine-driven, slightly allergic to repetitive tasks, and a big fan of a good book.  
I also enjoy attending tech events and meeting people who build cool things.  

Let’s build something smart (or at least funny) together! ☕🤖
