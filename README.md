# ⚙️ Automation Enjoyer  

## About me

* Letting computers handle the boring stuff — an automation enthusiast fueled by caffeine and mildly allergic to repetitive tasks.

* I always enjoy attending technology events and connecting with people who are creating really cool things.

## My tools of choice 

* Anything that promotes clean code and seamless integration. My preferences are Python and n8n.

## Let’s build something smart (or at least funny) together! ☕🤖
