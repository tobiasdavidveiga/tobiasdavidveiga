## About me

Letting computers handle the boring stuff â€” an automation enthusiast fueled by caffeine and mildly allergic to repetitive tasks.

I always enjoy attending technology events and connecting with people who are creating really cool things.

## My tools of choice 

Anything that promotes clean code and solves problems.

My preferences are:
*  **Python**
*  **n8n**

## Letâ€™s build something smart (or at least funny) together! â˜•ðŸ¤–
